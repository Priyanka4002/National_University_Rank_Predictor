# National_University_Rank_Predictor
The National University Rank Predictor is a Flask-based web application that predicts the rank of a university based on input features like tuition fee and enrollment numbers.  This application uses a deep learning model trained using TensorFlow/Keras, along with a scaler (loaded via Joblib) to normalize the inputs before prediction.  The goal is to help students, researchers, or educational bodies get an approximate ranking of a university based on available numeric data.

## 🧠 Project Description
This tool aims to assist:
- 📚 Students exploring university options,
- 📊 Researchers analyzing academic trends,
- 🏛️ Educational organizations evaluating institutions.
By inputting key numerical features, users receive an **estimated rank** that reflects the relative standing of a university, based on the data the model was trained on.
