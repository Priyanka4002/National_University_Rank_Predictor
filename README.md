# National_University_Rank_Predictor
The National University Rank Predictor is a Flask-based web application that predicts the rank of a university based on input features like tuition fee and enrollment numbers.  This application uses a deep learning model trained using TensorFlow/Keras, along with a scaler (loaded via Joblib) to normalize the inputs before prediction.
